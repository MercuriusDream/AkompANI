# Demo Videos

This guide provides two scripts:
- a 5-minute walkthrough for conversion,
- a 30-second short for reach.

Both scripts should emphasize the mission:
> Build an accompanying AI agent for people who have not yet developed strong agentic workflows.

## 1) Five-Minute Demo (Conversion)

## Goal
Show first-time framework developers they can go from idea to deployed agent quickly, with Bun + Elysia and easy API/KV integration.

## Shot List (Timeboxed)

1. `0:00-0:20` Problem and promise.
2. `0:20-1:00` Open the app and explain modes (Chat / Canvas / Deploy).
3. `1:00-2:20` Create a first agent from plain-English prompt.
4. `2:20-3:20` Edit one node and show API/KV-friendly flow pattern.
5. `3:20-4:30` Generate deploy object for Cloudflare Workers (Elysia + Bun).
6. `4:30-5:00` Recap + CTA (GitHub + docs).

## Suggested Narration

- "Akompani is designed for people who are new to agentic workflows: describe the job in plain language, then iterate visually."
- "Our runtime targets Bun + Elysia, so generated artifacts are practical and readable, not AI slop."
- "You can attach existing APIs directly, and you can include KV-style caching/state behavior in the flow."

## 2) Thirty-Second Demo (Reach)

## Goal
Deliver a high-velocity proof: code-to-deploy your own AI agent in under 30 seconds.

## Shot List (Timeboxed)

1. `0:00-0:05` Hook text: "From plain English to deployed agent in 30 seconds."
2. `0:05-0:12` Enter prompt in Chat mode.
3. `0:12-0:20` Show generated flow on Canvas.
4. `0:20-0:27` Deploy to Cloudflare Workers target.
5. `0:27-0:30` CTA: "Build your accompanying AI on Akompani."

## Overlay Captions

- "Bun + Elysia deploy artifacts"
- "Attach your existing APIs"
- "KV/cache-ready flows"

## Recording Settings

- Resolution: `1920x1080`
- FPS: `30`
- Cursor highlight: on
- Cut style: hard cuts, no long transitions

## Publish Order

1. Publish 30-second clip first on short-form channels.
2. Link the 5-minute walkthrough in the first comment and GitHub README.
