Include:
- affected file/path or feature
- reproduction steps or proof of concept
- impact assessment
- suggested mitigation (if available)

## Response Targets

- Initial acknowledgement: within 72 hours
- Triage/update: within 7 days when reproducible details are provided

## Disclosure

Please allow maintainers time to investigate and patch before public disclosure.
